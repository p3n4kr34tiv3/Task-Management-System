# Contributing to Taskly

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! ðŸŽ‰

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to Taskly, which is hosted on GitHub. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [Taskly Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to [project-email@example.com].

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report for Taskly. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report, reproduce the behavior, and find related reports.

Before creating bug reports, please check [this list](#before-submitting-a-bug-report) as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating a bug report, please [include as many details as possible](#how-do-i-submit-a-good-bug-report). Fill out [the required template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md), the information it asks for helps us resolve issues faster.

> **Note:** If you find a **Closed** issue that seems like it is the same thing that you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.

#### Before Submitting A Bug Report

* **Check the [documentation](README.md)** for tips on troubleshooting.
* **Perform a [cursory search](https://github.com/search?q=+is%3Aissue+user%3A%3Cthis-repo%3E)** to see if the problem has already been reported. If it has **and the issue is still open**, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Bug Report?

Bugs are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). After you've determined which repository your bug is related to, create an issue on that repository and provide the following information by filling in [the template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md).

Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
* **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible.
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those examples.
* **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
* **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.**
* **Include screenshots and animated GIFs** which show you following the described steps and clearly demonstrate the problem.
* **If you're reporting that Taskly crashed**, include a crash report with a stack trace from the operating system.

### Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion for Taskly, including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your suggestion and find related suggestions.

Before creating enhancement suggestions, please check [this list](#before-submitting-an-enhancement-suggestion) as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating an enhancement suggestion, please [include as many details as possible](#how-do-i-submit-a-good-enhancement-suggestion). Fill in [the template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md), including the steps that you imagine you would take if the feature you're requesting existed.

#### Before Submitting An Enhancement Suggestion

* **Check the [documentation](README.md)** to see if the feature is already implemented.
* **Perform a [cursory search](https://github.com/search?q=+is%3Aissue+user%3A%3Cthis-repo%3E)** to see if the enhancement has already been suggested. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.

#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Enhancement Suggestion?

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/). After you've determined which repository your enhancement suggestion is related to, create an issue on that repository and provide the following information:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.
* **Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** in as many details as possible.
* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**.
* **Describe the current behavior** and **explain which behavior you expected to see instead** and why.
* **Include screenshots and animated GIFs** which help you demonstrate the steps or point out the part of Taskly which the suggestion is related to.
* **Explain why this enhancement would be useful** to most Taskly users.
* **List some other task management tools or applications where this enhancement exists.**

### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to Taskly? You can start by looking through these `beginner` and `help-wanted` issues:

* [Beginner issues][beginner] - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
* [Help wanted issues][help-wanted] - issues which should be a bit more involved than `beginner` issues.

Both issue lists are sorted by total number of comments. While not perfect, number of comments is a reasonable proxy for impact a given change will have.

### Pull Requests

The process described here has several goals:

- Maintain Taskly's quality
- Fix problems that are important to users
- Engage the community in working toward the best possible Taskly
- Enable a sustainable system for Taskly's maintainers to review contributions

Please follow these steps to have your contribution considered by the maintainers:

1. Follow all instructions in [the template](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)
2. Follow the [styleguides](#styleguides)
3. After you submit your pull request, verify that all [status checks](https://help.github.com/articles/about-status-checks/) are passing <details><summary>What if the status checks are failing?</summary>If a status check is failing, and you believe that the failure is unrelated to your change, please leave a comment on the pull request explaining why you believe the failure is unrelated. A maintainer will re-run the status check for you. If we conclude that the failure was a false positive, then we will open an issue to track that problem with our status check suite.</details>

While the prerequisites above must be satisfied prior to having your pull request reviewed, the reviewer(s) may ask you to complete additional design work, tests, or other changes before your pull request can be ultimately accepted.

## Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages

* Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
* Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
* Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
* Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line
* When only changing documentation, include `[ci skip]` in the commit title

### JavaScript Styleguide

All JavaScript must adhere to [JavaScript Standard Style](https://standardjs.com/).

* Prefer the object spread operator (`{...anotherObj}`) to `Object.assign()`
* Inline `export`s with expressions whenever possible
  ```js
  // Use this:
  export default class ClassName {

  }

  // Instead of:
  class ClassName {

  }
  export default ClassName
  ```

### CSS Styleguide

* Use camelCase for class names
* Use kebab-case for custom properties (CSS variables)
* Use a consistent indentation (2 spaces)
* Include a single space after the colon in property declarations
* Include a single space before the opening brace of rule declarations
* Separate each rule declaration with a blank line

### TypeScript Styleguide

* All TypeScript files must pass TypeScript compilation without errors
* Use explicit types for function parameters and return values
* Use interfaces for object shapes
* Use type aliases for unions and primitives
* Prefer `interface` over `type` for object shapes

### React Styleguide

* Use functional components with hooks instead of class components
* Use TypeScript for type checking
* Use PropTypes for runtime type checking in addition to TypeScript
* Use the component composition pattern instead of inheritance
* Use the container/presentational component pattern when appropriate
* Use default props for optional props
* Use destructuring for props and state
* Use template literals for string concatenation
* Use arrow functions for event handlers

## Additional Notes

### Issue and Pull Request Labels

This section lists the labels we use to help us track and manage issues and pull requests.

[GitHub search](https://help.github.com/articles/searching-issues/) makes it easy to use labels for finding groups of issues or pull requests you're interested in.

The labels are loosely grouped by their purpose, but it's not required that every issue have a label from every group or that an issue can't have more than one label from the same group.

#### Type of Issue and Issue State

* `bug` - Issues that are bugs
* `enhancement` - Issues that are feature requests
* `documentation` - Issues that are documentation related
* `beginner` - Issues that are good for beginners
* `help-wanted` - Issues that need assistance
* `question` - Issues that are questions
* `duplicate` - Issues that are duplicates of other issues
* `wontfix` - Issues that will not be fixed
* `invalid` - Issues that are invalid
* `stale` - Issues that have not been updated in a while

#### Pull Request Labels

* `work-in-progress` - Pull requests that are not ready to be merged
* `needs-review` - Pull requests that need review
* `needs-changes` - Pull requests that need changes
* `ready-to-merge` - Pull requests that are ready to be merged
